This is the source repository for the [Flare docs](https://docs.flare.network/) site.

## Run locally

To get started, you have two main options for setting up your development environment: utilizing a Docker container or a manual setup. While both methods are effective, we recommend using a Docker container to avoid version discrepancies with the rest of the team.

### Using Docker Container

1. [Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and install Docker Desktop

2. In the command line navigate to the repository folder and build the docker container with the command:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --no-start
   ```

3. After this step, You can run it from the Docker Desktop app. Open Docker Desktop, navigate to the Containers section, and run the `docs-private` container.

4. To see the console logs or errors, open the Docker Desktop app and go to the `docs-private` container details under the containers section.

   Check all the warnings because the automatic build process will not accept them when creating a pull request.

5. From your browser, go to URL [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) to see the documentation page.

6. Press the stop button in the Docker Desktop app to stop it.
