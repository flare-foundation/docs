# FAQ

### Do I need to re-whitelist my peering node IP?

No, you do not need to re-whitelist the IP address.

### I want to have greater redundancy and would like to whitelist multiple nodes, can I do that?

You can whitelist multiple IPs per single provider.

### Can an unhealthy node cause my TXs to revert?

Yes, at times, not enough connected peers can cause your transactions to revert. Make sure your node state is healthy and that it has enough connected peers.

### What is the required number of connected peers?

If the number of peers falls below 19, there is a good chance that some peers have disconnected from your node, try to restart it.

## Troubleshooting

### The node does not sync after a long time and dies abruptly, what to do?

Make sure, that the database location has sufficient disk space (database size might change a lot during bootstrapping).

### I'm getting strange errors on submission and revert messages are cryptic

This might be a symptom of node connection error. Try to restart node and make sure you have enough disk space.

### I am getting a strange error `failed to send GetAcceptedFrontier(MtF8bVH241hetCQJgsKEdKyJBs8vhp1BC, 11111111111111111111111111111111LpoYY, NUMBER)` when bootstrapping the node, what should I do?

It seems, that your node got disconnected during the bootstrapping. Restart the node, but to speed up the process, use `--existing` flag to reuse the data and donâ€™t do the bootstrap from zero.

### I have synced the node but it does not become healthy. What can I do?

It often happens that a new node gets synced but stays unhealthy for no apparent reason. A restart with `--existing` flag usually helps.
