# Troubleshooting Price Providers

### When trying to whitelist my address I get an error - vote power too low
This error means your vote power is too low and you can't yet whitelist your address. This can happen for two reasons, either your vote power is below the vote power of the 100th provider in the whitelist. The other reason could be that your current vote power is high enough but a new vote power block was not chosen yet. Note that a new vote power block is chosen per new reward epoch. 
### I have increased my vote power, but the address is still not getting whitelisted, what is wrong?

Addresses are whitelisted based on vote power as reflected in the vote power block of the current reward epoch. Increased vote power on a different block will not enable your address to be whitelisted.

### How do I find the vote power block of the current reward epoch?

In the FtsoManager [contract](https://songbird-explorer.flare.network/address/0xbfA12e4E1411B62EdA8B035d71735667422A6A9e/read-contract) use #8 for reading `getCurrentRewardEpoch`. Then use #13 `getRewardEpochVotePowerBlock` where one should set the current reward epoch number (from #8) and see the vote power block for that epoch.

### How do I check my vote power for a specific vote power block?

In the WNat [contract](https://songbird-explorer.flare.network/address/0x02f0826ef6aD107Cfc861152B32B52fD11BaB9ED/read-contract) use #26 `votePowerOfAt,` set the address and the block and read the response.

### My submissions are reverted as being in the wrong epoch

You might be submitting a bit too late in the current epoch. Try to submit the price a few seconds earlier. You might want to consider running an observation node that provides a better quality connection to the network. Also, check if your server time is synced with through Network Time Protocol (NTP).

### I am experiencing strange reverts when submitting and revealing prices

The unexpected reverts might come from the too low gas amount provided to submit/reveal transactions. Increase the gas limit of the transaction to 2500000.
