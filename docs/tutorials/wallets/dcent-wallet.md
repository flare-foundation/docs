# D'CENT Wallet

D'CENT Biometric Wallet is a non-custodial hardware wallet and is considered one of the most secure ways to manage your crypto assets.

## Getting Started

Purchase a D'CENT Biometric hardware wallet from the [official D'CENT shop](https://dcentwallet.com/Shop) or download their software wallet/mobile app from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dcent-wallet/id1447206611) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kr.iotrust.dcent.wallet). Then either initialize a new wallet or import an existing one from a recovery phrase. The official D'cent device setup help guides can be found here: [https://userguide.dcentwallet.com/biometric-wallet/setting-up](https://userguide.dcentwallet.com/biometric-wallet/setting-up)

Once your device is set up and synced with the mobile app you will need to add SGB to your listed assets:

1. Ensure the D'cent biometric wallet is updated with the latest firmware, v2.16.7 or later
2. Login to your D'cent mobile app and have your device turned on, unlocked, and paired via Bluetooth
3. Click the `+` sign on the bottom right of the `Account` tab
4. Search Songbird in the search box
5. Select the `Songbird Token (SGB)`
6. Name your SGB account and click `Create`

### Wrap and Delegate

Users can wrap and delegate their SGB/WSGB using D'cent`s native FTSO Portal:

1. Click the `Discovery` tab at the bottom middle of the screen
2. Select the `FTSO Portal` from the menu then click `Go`
3. Choose the Songbird account you wish to use and click `Connect`
4. You will need to wrap your SGB by clicking `SGB ↔️ WSGB` marked in green near the top middle of the screen
5. Input the SGB amount you want to wrap and click the green `SGB ↔️ WSGB` box
6. Click `Confirm` and follow the prompts to sign the transaction with your hardware device
7. You can now delegate your WSGB by clicking `Add delegation`. _Providers listed as a `Partner` have additional security features integrated with D'cent_.
8. Select a provider and input a % amount of WSGB holdings you want to delegate to their service and press `Delegate`
9. Click `Confirm` and follow the prompts to sign the transaction with your hardware device
10. Repeat steps 7 - 9 if you wish to add a second provider (up to two)
