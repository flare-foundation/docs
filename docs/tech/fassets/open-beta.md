# FAssets Open Beta

The FAssets system is currently in the open-beta period on the [Coston](../flare.md#flare-networks) test network.
To ensure a seamless experience for open-beta participants, the FAssets codebase was updated based on the results of the closed-beta.

Currently, the Open Beta period only supports minting of test `$XRP` assets, which produces `$FtestXRP` FAssets.

## FAssets Open Beta Objectives

The objectives of the FAssets open beta are:

* Test the FAssets system in a live environment.
* Gather feedback from users to improve the FAssets functionality and documentation.
* Continue the education of the various roles supporting FAssets, such as [agents](../../tech/fassets/index.md#agents), [liquidators](../../tech/fassets/index.md#liquidators), and [challengers](../../tech/fassets/index.md#challengers), so that they can get practical experience and prepare themselves for the general launch of the FAssets system.
* Identify and resolve any remaining inconsistencies to ensure the system is as robust as possible before adding real user funds.

## FAssets Open Beta Phases

This open-beta period consists of two phases:

* **Phase One**: In this phase, agents will be onboarded.
Although other advanced users can join, they can interact with the FAssets system only via the command-line interface.
* **Phase Two**: In this phase, a graphical user interface will be released for everyone to use instead of the command line.
