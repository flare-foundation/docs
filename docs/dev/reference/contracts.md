# Contract Addresses

**The most secure way** to retrieve contract addresses is [from the blockchain itself](#retrieval-from-blockchain).

Alternatively, you can also get the addresses [from the blockchain's source code](#retrieval-from-source-code).

As a convenience, this page also provides the [list of all Flare's smart contract on-chain addresses](#retrieval-from-documentation).

!!! attention

    During development, it is OK to use the handy contract address list provided here.

    However, **at least once before deploying any product**, you should check that the addresses are correct using only on-chain data.

## Retrieval from Blockchain

The **Price Submitter** smart contract is deployed in the Genesis block at an **immutable** address: `0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000003`, both on Flare and Songbird.

From it, the following contract addresses can be retrieved:

- The **FTSO Manager** (`PriceSubmitter.getFtsoManager()`)
    - Individual **FTSO** contracts (`FtsoManager.getFtsos()`)
    - The **FTSO Reward Manager** (`FtsoManager.rewardManager()`)
        - **WNat** (`FtsoRewardManager.wNat()`)
- The **FTSO Registry** (`PriceSubmitter.getFtsoRegistry()`)
- The **FTSO Whitelister** (`PriceSubmitter.voterWhitelister()`)

!!! note

    On the Flare Network, there is also a handy contract named **Address Updater** accessible through the **Price Submitter** which lists all other contracts via the `getContractNamesAndAddresses()` method.

    - **Address Updater** (`PriceSubmitter.getAddressUpdater()`)

## Retrieval from Source Code

The [Flare Smart Contracts repository](https://gitlab.com/flarenetwork/flare-smart-contracts) contains an autogenerated JSON file listing the deployed addresses of all Flare contracts.

You can find this file in the `deployment/deploys` folder, and parse it to retrieve the addresses of any Flare contract.

As stated at the beginning, **remember to double-check the addresses** are correct using only blockchain data.

## Retrieval from Documentation

Finally, for convenience, here is the list of all contract addresses.

As stated at the beginning, **remember to double-check the addresses** are correct using only blockchain data.
