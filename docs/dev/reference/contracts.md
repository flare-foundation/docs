# Contract Addresses

**The most secure way** to retrieve contract addresses is [from the blockchain itself](#retrieval-from-blockchain).

Alternatively, you can also get the addresses [from the blockchain's source code](#retrieval-from-source-code).

As a convenience, this page also provides the [list of all Flare's smart contract on-chain addresses](#retrieval-from-documentation).

!!! attention

    During development, it is OK to use the handy contract address list provided here.

    However, **at least once before deploying any product**, you should check that the addresses are correct using one of the more secure methods.

## Retrieval from Blockchain

The **Price Submitter** smart contract is deployed in the Genesis block at an **immutable** address: `0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000003`, both on Flare and Songbird.

From it, the following contract addresses can be retrieved:

- The **FTSO Manager** (`getFtsoManager`)
    - Individual **FTSO** contracts (`getFtsos`)
        - **WNat** (Get from _any_ FTSO using `wNat`)
    - The **FTSO Reward Manager** (`rewardManager`)
    - The **FTSO Whitelister** (`voterWhitelister`)
- The **FTSO registry** (`getFtsoRegistry`)

## Retrieval from Source Code

The [Flare Smart Contracts repository](https://gitlab.com/flarenetwork/flare-smart-contracts){target=_blank} contains an autogenerated JSON file listing the deployed addresses of all Flare contracts.

You can find this file in the `deployment/deploys` folder, and parse it to retrieve the addresses of any Flare contract.

| Contract  | Flare                               | Songbird                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Branch    | `flare_network_deployed_code`       | `songbird_network_deployed_code`       |
| JSON file | [flare.json][f-json]{target=_blank} | [songbird.json][s-json]{target=_blank} |

[f-json]: https://gitlab.com/flarenetwork/flare-smart-contracts/-/blob/flare_network_deployed_code/deployment/deploys/flare.json
[s-json]: https://gitlab.com/flarenetwork/flare-smart-contracts/-/blob/songbird_network_deployed_code/deployment/deploys/songbird.json

## Retrieval from Documentation

Finally, for convenience, here is the list of all contract addresses.

As stated at the beginning, **remember to double-check the addresses** are correct using one of the more secure methods explained above.

| Contract                 | Flare Address                                  | Songbird Address                               |
