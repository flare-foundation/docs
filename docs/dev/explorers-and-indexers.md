# Block Explorers and Indexers

Flare provides a block explorer for each of the networks in its ecosystem.
All explorers are a fork of [Blockscout](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout), adapted to the Flare networks ([Blockscout Docs](https://docs.blockscout.com)).

API documentation for each network's explorer:

* [Flare](https://flare-explorer.flare.network/api-docs)

[API access](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-users/api) to the Coston Explorer is enabled for noncommercial use only.
