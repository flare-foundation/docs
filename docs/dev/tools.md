# Tooling

The following tools already support the Flare network.

## API Providers

These companies provide API services through their own [RPC nodes](glossary.md#rpc).
Unlike [Flare's public RPC endpoints](./reference/network-config.md), paid services are typically not rate-limited.

* [Flare API Portal](https://api-portal.flare.network/)
* [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/blog/flare-ankr-s-next-blockchain-connection/)
* [NOWNodes](https://nownodes.io/nodes)

## Identity and Account Abstraction

* [web3auth](https://web3auth.io/docs/connect-blockchain/flare)

## Indexing and Querying

Blockchains typically store the history of all transactions but not the latest, consolidated state of individual accounts.
The companies below provide fast access to this information

* [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/flare/)
* [SubQuery](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/flare.html)
* [Subsquid](https://docs.subsquid.io/evm-indexing/supported-networks/)

## Monitoring Tools

These tools report information about Flare networks:

* [Flare Builders](https://www.flare.builders/)
* [FlareMetrics](https://flaremetrics.io/)
* [Validators, presented by Towo Labs](https://validators.towolabs.com/)

## Storage

Storing large amounts of data on-chain is typically very expensive.
These are some decentralized storage alternatives.

* [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/developers/introduction/filecoin-and-ipfs)
* [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech)
* [Crust Network](https://www.crust.network)
* [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud)
* [Lighthouse](https://www.lighthouse.storage)
* [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org)

## Wallets

Please see the [Wallet user guides](../user/wallets/index.md) for a list of wallets currently supporting the Flare network.
