# Bifrost Wallet

Bifrost Wallet is a **non-custodial mobile wallet** available for both Android and iOS.
You can view your portfolio of crypto assets, access decentralized applications through the in-app browser and perform operations on various blockchain networks, including sending, receiving, wrapping and delegating Flare (`$FLR`) and Songbird (`$SGB`).

## Getting Started

Start by downloading Bifrost Wallet from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bifrost-wallet/id1577198351) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bifrostwallet.app) and either create a new wallet or import an existing one from a recovery phrase.

The official guides in the [Bifrost Wallet help center](https://support.bifrostwallet.com) may be of assistance.

!!! note "Please make sure you have installed at least version 0.4.5"

!!! note "XRP Airdrop"

    Note that, **once `$FLR` distribution begins**,  users who imported their Ethereum-style claim address into Bifrost to access the XRP airdrop will automatically see their tokens in the Flare asset row in the `COINS` section.
