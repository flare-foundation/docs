## Wrap and Delegate

Once connected to the Flare or Songbird network, enter the address of the website or dapp you wish to use to wrap and delegate in any web3 browser. A few of the data providers have developed dapps integrated with their websites that allow users to wrap, delegate and claim $FLR and $SGB rewards. Delegating using this method is not exclusive to one specific provider, as these dapps allow you to choose from a number of different providers.

Many data providers have developed dapps for wrapping and delegation. Take a look at flaremetrics.io and pick the one you prefer.

Other providers have their own websites and are developing similar dapps. See the full list of active signal providers on flaremetrics.io/ftso.
