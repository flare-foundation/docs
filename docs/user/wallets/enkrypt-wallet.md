# Enkrypt Wallet

[Enkrypt](https://www.enkrypt.com/?mtm_campaign=Flare%20Wiki%20-%20Getting%20started%20with%20Enkrypt) is a **multichain**, **open-source** and **non-custodial** wallet that tracks no data.
It interacts with Polkadot, Ethereum, Bitcoin and more, all directly in the browser.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Enkrypt](https://www.enkrypt.com/?mtm_campaign=Flare%20Wiki%20-%20Getting%20started%20with%20Enkrypt).
2. Create a new wallet or import an existing wallet to Enkrypt.
3. Securely back up your recovery phrase offline.
4. Protect your Enkrypt wallet with a password.

Once your wallet is set up, you will need to connect to one of Flare's networks.
This involves adding a custom network via the following steps:

1. [Add Flare or Songbird as a custom networks](https://help.myetherwallet.com/en/articles/6434713-enkrypt-connecting-to-networks-and-dapps) in Enkrypt using these parameters:

    === "Songbird"

         | Field                  | Value                                          |
         | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
         | **Chain ID**           | 19                                             |
         | **Network Name**       | Songbird                                       |
         | **Currency Symbol**    | SGB                                            |
         | **New RPC URL**        | <https://songbird-api.flare.network/ext/C/rpc> |
         | **Block Explorer URL** | <https://songbird-explorer.flare.network>      |

    === "Flare"

         | Field                  | Value                                       |
         | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
         | **Chain ID**           | 14                                          |
         | **Network Name**       | Flare                                       |
         | **Currency Symbol**    | FLR                                         |
         | **New RPC URL**        | <https://flare-api.flare.network/ext/C/rpc> |
         | **Block Explorer URL** | <https://flare-explorer.flare.network>      |

You should now see your tokens in the balance and be able to use Enkrypt to connect to any web DApp designed for the Flare or Songbird networks.

## Wrap and Delegate

Once connected to the Flare or Songbird network, enter the address of the website or dapp you wish to use to wrap and delegate in any web3 browser.
A few of the [FTSO](glossary.md#ftso) data providers have developed dapps integrated with their websites that allow users to wrap, delegate and claim `$FLR` and `$SGB` rewards.
Delegating using this method is not exclusive to one specific provider, as these dapps allow you to choose from a number of different providers.
Take a look at [flaremetrics.io](https://flaremetrics.io/ftso) and pick the one you prefer.
