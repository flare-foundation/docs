## Wrap and Delegate

Once connected to the Songbird network, enter the address of the website or dapp you wish to use to wrap and delegate in the MetaMask browser.
A few of the data providers have developed dapps integrated with their websites that allow users to wrap, delegate and claim `$SGB` rewards.
Delegating using this method is not exclusive to one specific provider, as these dapps allow you to choose from a number of different providers.

Examples of data providers that have developed dapps for wrapping and delegation are FTSO AU and Aureus Ox.
Their dapps are available at [app.ftso.com.au](https://app.ftso.com.au/wrap){target=_blank} and [aureusox.com/dashboard](https://aureusox.com/dashboard){target=_blank}.

Other providers have their own websites and are developing similar dapps.
