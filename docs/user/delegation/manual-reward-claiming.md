## Where is the reward data found?

All reward data can be found in the FTSO Reward Manager.

In the FTSO reward manager contract use the `getEpochsWithUnclaimedRewards(beneficiary_address)` method.

## What is the claim API?

API for claiming can be found in the FTSO Reward Manager, see method `claimReward (_recipient address, _rewardEpochs uint256[])`.
The address should be your address and reward epochs should include the list of epochs you want to claim rewards for.
You may claim rewards for multiple epochs at one go.
